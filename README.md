## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of the **AGI Agent Application Hackathon**.  
It aims to support victims of **rental fraud** by providing AI-powered legal document analysis and actionable legal guidance by leveraging advanced AI agent technologies.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ **Contract Analysis**: Uses Upstage OCR and GPT models to extract and analyze key clauses from rental contracts, identifying hidden risks and unfavorable terms.
- ✅ **Actionable Legal Guidance**: Users can describe their legal situation, and based on BERT-powered analysis, the system provides relevant laws, precedents, required documents, and step-by-step instructions for legal response.
- ✅ **Contextual Q&A**: Users can ask questions in natural language, and the system — fine-tuned on legal texts using BERT — returns document-specific, context-aware legal answers.

## 📁 Dataset & References

### 📊 Dataset Used

- **LBox Open Dataset**  
  Korean court rulings and legal clauses used to fine-tune the BERT model for legal prediction tasks.

- **Custom OCR Samples**  
  Real-world rental contracts, including the official government-standard lease agreement, were collected and anonymized for OCR testing, parsing, and downstream legal analysis.
